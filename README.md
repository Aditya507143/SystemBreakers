# SystemBreakers
The project is aimed at developing a platform which enables the citizens of a certain region to hold their respective civic bodies accountable for their actions, or inactions as the case may be. The platform would consist of a simple interface from where the citizen can upload geo tagged images of problems. These then will either be classified by the user or by the system under certain predefined categories. The concerned civic authorities would then be informed of the same through an update/popup on their account. The progress, or the lack of the same, can be monitored by the public by pictures posted by other users and the same would be regularly updated on social media platforms. The platform for have an emphasis on ecological problems affecting the citizens and environment of the area. Thus, the application aims to enable citizens to fulfill one of their fundamental duties - citizen participation and enable government accountability through citizen oversight.
